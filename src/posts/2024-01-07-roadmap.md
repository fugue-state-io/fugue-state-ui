fugue-state.io is a work in progress, fugue-state will change over the course of it's lifetime. This document serves as a brief outline of improvements to be made, feature descriptions, and outreach plans.

## Improvements
fugue-state.io doesn't work on iPhone browsers due to unknown reasons. It remains to be seen whether or not it is possible to support iPhones. fugue-state should be able to run in all modern browsers.

## Features
In order for fugue-state to succeed in it's goal a small number of additional features must be added. Some high value features are adding pitch transposition and disabling the preserve pitch and slow down or speed up feature. Implementing compression and mono mixing for mid and side encoding.

## Outreach
fugue-state needs users as such I'll begin shilling it like a mad man. Various sub reddits and the twitter are of interest
